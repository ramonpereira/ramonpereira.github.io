# Deceptive Storytelling using AI Planning and ChatGPT

## Introduction

Storytelling can be defined as the act of sharing experiences, emotions, or knowledge through the use of narrative techniques such as character development, plot structure, and descriptive language, in order to create a connection with the listener or reader. Recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) dialogue systems are able tell (convincing) stories and interact with humans and other artificial agents. 

## Project Description

The idea of this project is employing recent AI Planning techniques for storytelling [1] and deception [2] and combine them with Large Language Models, e.g., ChatGPT [3].
So the aim of the project would be to develop an AI system that is able to mislead and deceive via storytelling. This AI system should be able to reason about its knowledge and then autonomously adjust the story it tells depending on what its interlocutors might know and on how sensitive it considers the conversation topic to be.

## Deliverables
- A report describing the developed approaches, as well as the experiments used for evaluation, and the related work;
- A project on GitHub containing the code, experiments, etc.
