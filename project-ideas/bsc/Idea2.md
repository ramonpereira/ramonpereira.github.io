# Intent Recognition in Real-World Navigation Environments using ChatGPT

## Background
Intent Recognition (alternatively, Goal Recognition) is the task of discerning the intended goal that an observed acting agent aims to achieve given a sequence of observations [1], whereas Plan Recognition consists of identifying the plan (i.e., sequence of actions) to achieve such an intended goal [2].
The most effective approaches to Goal and Plan Recognition rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) Planning techniques. Namely, such effect approaches rely on model-free and model-based AI techniques.

## Description
The aim of the project is to develop goal recognition techniques using ChatGPT [3]. 
It is also expected to experiment and evaluate the implemented techniques over real-world navigation environments, such as Google Maps (by observing the agents by bike, on foot, and by car).

## Deliverables
- A report describing the developed approaches, as well as the experiments used for evaluation, and the related work;
- A project on GitHub containing the code, experiments, etc.
