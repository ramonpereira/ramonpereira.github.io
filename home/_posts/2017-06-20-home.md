Hello, my name is Ramon Fraga Pereira and I am a Ph.D. student at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), Brazil, under the guidance of Dr. [Felipe Meneguzzi](http://www.meneguzzi.eu/felipe/). 

My research is in the field of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Goal and Plan Recognition using Automated Planning techniques for both Single-Agent and Multi-Agent Systems.
