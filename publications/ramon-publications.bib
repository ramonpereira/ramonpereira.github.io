  abstract =  {Automated planning can be used to efficiently recognize goals and plans from partial or full observed action sequences. In this paper, we propose goal recognition heuristics that rely on information from planning landmarks - facts or actions that must occur if a plan is to achieve a goal when starting from some initial state. We develop two such heuristics: the first estimates goal completion by considering the ratio between achieved and extracted landmarks of a candidate goal, while the second takes into account how unique each landmark is among landmarks for all candidate goals. We empirically evaluate these heuristics over both standard goal/plan recognition problems, and a set of very large problems. We show that our heuristics can recognize goals more accurately, and run orders of magnitude faster, than the current state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Assessing whether an agent is actually executing steps towards a goal, or has abandoned it, is important when multiple agents are trying to achieve joint goals, or when agents commit to achieving goals for each other. Making such inference for a single goal by observing only plan traces is not a trivial task because agents often deviate from the optimal plans for various reasons, including the pursuit of multiple goals or the inability to act optimally. In this paper, we develop an approach based on planning techniques that addresses the problem of detecting sub-optimal steps and of determining whether an agent will honour a commitment. Specifically, we use domain-independent heuristics, landmarks (properties or actions that cannot be avoided to achieve a goal from an initial state), and fact partitions to make such inferences. We empirically show, for a number of representative domains, that our approach infers sub-optimal steps with very high accuracy and detects commitment abandonment in nearly all cases.},

  abstract = {When acting, agents may deviate from the optimal plan, either because they are not perfect optimizers or because they interleave multiple unrelated tasks. In this paper, we detect such deviations by analyzing a set of observations and a monitored goal to determine if an observed agent’s actions contribute towards achieving the goal. We address this problem without pre-defined static plan libraries, and instead use a planning domain definition to represent the problem and the expected agent behavior. At the core of our approach, we exploit domain-independent heuristics for estimating the goal distance, incorporating the concept of landmarks (actions which all plans must undertake if they are to achieve the goal). We evaluate the resulting approach empirically using several known planning domains, and demonstrate that our approach effectively detects such deviations.},

  abstract = {Computer-based human activity recognition of daily living has recently attracted much interest due to its applicability to ambient assisted living. Such applications require the automatic recognition of high-level activities composed of multiple actions performed by human beings in an environment. In this work, we address the problem of activity recognition in an indoor environment, focusing on a kitchen scenario. Unlike existing approaches that identify single actions from video sequences, we also identify the goal towards which the subject of the video is pursuing. Our hybrid approach combines a deep learning architecture to analyze raw video data and identify individual actions which are then processed by a goal recognition algorithm that uses a plan library describing possible overarching activities to identify the ultimate goal of the subject in the video. Experiments show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art for identifying cooking activities in a kitchen scenario.},

Recognizing goals with minimal domain knowledge as an agent executes its plan requires efficient algorithms to sift through a large space of hypotheses. In this paper, we develop an online approach to recognize goals in both continuous and discrete domains using a combination of goal mirroring and a generalized notion of landmarks adapted from the planning literature. Extensive experiments demonstrate the approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art online recognition, and substantially more accurate.},

New users often find it challenging to understand the plan generation process, while experienced users often find it difficult to track semantic errors and efficiency issues. To simplify this process, in this paper, we develop a cloud-based planning tool with code editing and state-space visualization capabilities. The code editor focuses on visualizing the domain, problem, and resulting sample plan, helping the user to see how such descriptions are connected without changing context. The visualization tool explores two alter- native visualizations aimed at illustrating the operation of the planning process and how the domain dynamics evolve during plan execution.},

Plan recognition can be used to infer which plans are being executed from observations of sequences of activities being performed by an agent. In this work, we use this symbolic plan recognition algorithm to find out which plan the agent is performing and develop a failure prediction system, based on plan library information and in a simplified calendar that manages the goals the agent has to achieve. This failure predictor is able to monitor the sequence of agent actions and detects if an action is taking too long or does not match the plan that the agent was expected to perform. We showcase this approach successfully in a health-care prototype system.},

	abstract = {While domain descriptions are often shared and manipulated through diagrams, most complex domains are still described using text-based languages. Code becomes an intermediary between the real-world and an abstract idea, and the programmer is merely a converter of diagrams into code. For automated planning this is no different. The state transition function is described in terms of a textual representation of actions and, although simple actions require little effort to define by the user, the learning process is often slow. New users have no metaphor to help them to visualize the domain description that they are working on and little information about why a planner fails due to formalization errors. In this paper, we propose a visual abstraction for both the planning domain actions and the planning process itself, to facilitate the design of classical planning domains. Using this abstraction, we expect to improve the learning curve for defining and subsequently diagnosing problems with new planning domains.},

  abstract = {Jason is an AgentSpeak interpreter for multi-agent system development, in which agents are described in the AgentSpeak language. Therefore, we only have to describe the agent behavior, but the environment does not follow this style, it requires a Java description of how the actions and perceptions operate. This choice of implementation guarantees that even complex environments can be created for JASON, but it requires knowledge about both Java and JASON’s Application Programming Interface (API). In this paper we aim to fill the gap between the languages with an AgentSpeak-like description of the environment. To overcome this gap we propose LOCUS, a source-to-source compiler which generates a Java description of the environment for JASON, providing the user with an easier starting point to create complex environments with a consistent description for both the agents and the environment. The output of LOCUS can be further modified if required, not limiting the user to the features already provided by LOCUS.},
