  abstract =  {Automated planning can be used to efficiently recognize goals and plans from partial or full observed action sequences. In this paper, we propose goal recognition heuristics that rely on information from planning landmarks - facts or actions that must occur if a plan is to achieve a goal when starting from some initial state. We develop two such heuristics: the first estimates goal completion by considering the ratio between achieved and extracted landmarks of a candidate goal, while the second takes into account how unique each landmark is among landmarks for all candidate goals. We empirically evaluate these heuristics over both standard goal/plan recognition problems, and a set of very large problems. We show that our heuristics can recognize goals more accurately, and run orders of magnitude faster, than the current state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Assessing whether an agent is actually executing steps towards a goal, or has abandoned it, is important when multiple agents are trying to achieve joint goals, or when agents commit to achieving goals for each other. Making such inference for a single goal by observing only plan traces is not a trivial task because agents often deviate from the optimal plans for various reasons, including the pursuit of multiple goals or the inability to act optimally. In this paper, we develop an approach based on planning techniques that addresses the problem of detecting sub-optimal steps and of determining whether an agent will honour a commitment. Specifically, we use domain-independent heuristics, landmarks (properties or actions that cannot be avoided to achieve a goal from an initial state), and fact partitions to make such inferences. We empirically show, for a number of representative domains, that our approach infers sub-optimal steps with very high accuracy and detects commitment abandonment in nearly all cases.},

  abstract = {The 2016 edition of the Multi-Agent Programming Contest used the Agents in the City as its new scenario, which consisted on the execution of various logistics tasks within a realistic city topology using a number of different vehicle types. The complexity of the scenario and variety of tasks posed a challenging problem suitable for a decentralised multi-agent solution. In this paper we describe the winning solution for the contest, providing insights into how we designed our solution and organised our team, as well as some discussion on a few of our matches.},

	keywords = {Planning; Visualization; Metaphor},
	abstract = {While domain descriptions are often shared and manipulated through diagrams, most complex domains are still described using text-based languages. Code becomes an intermediary between the real-world and an abstract idea, and the programmer is merely a converter of diagrams into code. For automated planning this is no different. The state transition function is described in terms of a textual representation of actions and, although simple actions require little effort to define by the user, the learning process is often slow. New users have no metaphor to help them to visualize the domain description that they are working on and little information about why a planner fails due to formalization errors. In this paper, we propose a visual abstraction for both the planning domain actions and the planning process itself, to facilitate the design of classical planning domains. Using this abstraction, we expect to improve the learning curve for defining and subsequently diagnosing problems with new planning domains.},

Including components from hackathons and unconferences, as well as parallel educational sessions, Brainhack fosters novel collaborations around the interests of its attendees. Here we provide an overview of its structure, past events, and example projects. Additionally, we outline current innovations such as regional events and post-conference publications.
