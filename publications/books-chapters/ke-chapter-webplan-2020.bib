abstract="Automated planning tools are complex pieces of software that take declarative domain descriptions and generate plans from domains and problems. New users often find it challenging to understand the plan generation process, while experienced users often find it difficult to track semantic errors and efficiency issues. In response, we develop a cloud-based planning tool with code editing and state-space visualization capabilities that simplifies this process. The code editor focuses on visualizing the domain, problem, and resulting sample plan, helping the user see how such descriptions are connected without changing context. The visualization tool explores two alternative visualizations aimed at illustrating the operation of the planning process and how the domain dynamics evolve during plan execution.",
