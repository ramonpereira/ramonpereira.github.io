abstract = {Automated planning tools are complex pieces of software that take declarative domain descriptions and generate plans for complex domains. 
New users often find it challenging to understand the plan generation process, while experienced users often find it difficult to track semantic errors and efficiency issues. 
To simplify this process, in this paper, we develop a cloud-based planning tool with code editing, code verification and validation, and problem visualization capabilities.
The code editor focuses on the domain, problem, and resulting plan and other textual information, helping the user see how such descriptions are connected without changing context across multiple screens. 
The visualization tool includes two alternative visualization schemes aimed at illustrating the explored state-space and dependencies between actions and predicates during plan execution.}
